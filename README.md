# Project: .NET Joke Generator

## üöÄ Project Description

This is a clean, minimal project for the "Web Technologies with .NET" submission. It functions as a dynamic **Joke Generator**.

The application uses an **ASP.NET Core Minimal API** as a secure backend to proxy requests to the external Official Joke API. 
The core architectural feature demonstrated is **server-side API integration** via `HttpClient`, where a button click triggers the full fetch, processing, and display cycle on the single Razor Page frontend.
